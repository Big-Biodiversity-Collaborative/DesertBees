## üìÇ Folder Contents

**data:** Contains the original downloads of raw and filtered data from GBIF ([Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/)). Not included due to excessively large size are the climate data used for modeling. The climate data, which have been excluded using gitignore, are from [WorldClim](https://worldclim.org/) (wc2-5 files) and the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/) (CMIP5) (cmip5 files). The data in this folder are used to produce the figures.

**src:** Contains code for filtering the data, running models, and generating figures.

**output:** Contains figures and model outputs.

**images:** Contains reference pictures for filtering the data.
